# Option-pricing-models
This project uses both the Black-Scholes closed-form model and Monte Carlo simulation. It demonstrates both quantitative finance skills including numerical methods and risk-neutral valuation.

This notebook contains:
- Implementing the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulations
- Analysed the convergence behaviour, through comparing both models
- Computed Greeks to understand hedging and risk management
